This repository contains projects that involve cleaning, visualizing, modeling and presenting sets of data that I have found interesting. They are organized by the step(s) in the data science workflow that they emphasize. For example, a project that required scraping data from a webpage, cleaning it, and exploring it for basic insights might be listed under "Fetching," "Cleaning," "Exploration," and "Visualization."
